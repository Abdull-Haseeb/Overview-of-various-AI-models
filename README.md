## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are computational algorithms designed to simulate human intelligence and solve complex problems. These models leverage data and patterns to make predictions, classify information, generate content, and more. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive overview of various AI models commonly used in different domains.

## AI Models

### 1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

CNNs are a class of deep learning models primarily used for image recognition tasks. They excel at capturing spatial patterns and are widely used in computer vision applications like image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras

### 2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

RNNs are designed to process sequential data, making them ideal for natural language processing tasks. They have internal memory, allowing them to retain information from previous inputs, making them suitable for tasks like text generation, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.

Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras

### 3. Transformer

The Transformer model revolutionized natural language processing by introducing self-attention mechanisms. It enables parallel processing of sequences and is commonly used for machine translation, language understanding, and text generation tasks.

Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers

### 4. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, engaged in a competitive game. The generator generates data, and the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated data. They are popular for generating realistic images, music, and other creative tasks.

Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch

### 5. Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where agents learn to make decisions through trial and error. It is commonly used in robotics, game playing, and optimization tasks.

Frameworks: OpenAI Gym, Stable Baselines
